				<h2>PRONUNCIATION OF SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE</h2>
				<p>When learning a foreign language, most people have difficulties saying all new sounds correctly. However, they can be learned. We can help you learn pronunciation of almost any sound in any language. Pronunciation practice can be organized in the form of individual or group sessions.</p>

				<h2>ULTRASOUND TONGUE IMAGING</h2>
				<p>As a core method I use ultrasound tongue imaging which makes it possible to observe tongue movements during speech. Seeing your tongue during speech makes it easier to understand the necessary tongue shape, position, or movements, and easier to control the tongue when articulating new speech sounds. The method is completely safe and uninvasive, and is suitable for adults and children from about 5 years of age. More info link.</p>

				<h2>OUR METHODS</h2>
				<p>An important aspect of my clinical work is using only evidence based practices, meaning that all used methods have been verified in extensive research and have been proven to contribute to the improvement in speech production.
I offer comprehensive speech assessment, including acoustic analysis of speech and articulatory analysis of tongue movements. Detailed assessment is prerequisite for the correct diagnosis and for the selection of most appropriate therapy procedures.
I speak fluent English and conversational Czech. However, I can help you or your child learn any speech sound of any language.
