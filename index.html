				<h2>PRONUNCIATION OF SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE</h2>
				<p>When learning a foreign language, most people have difficulties saying new sounds correctly. For example, if you are a Czech speaker of English, is there a difference in how you say “pan” and “pen”? There are two different vowels in these words and they can be learned! I can help you learn the pronunciation of almost any sound in any language. Pronunciation practice can be organized in the form of individual or group sessions.</p>

				<h2>MY METHODS</h2>
				<p>An important aspect of my clinical work is using only evidence-based practices, meaning that all used methods have been verified in extensive research and have been proven to contribute to the improvement in speech production.
I offer comprehensive speech assessment, including acoustic analysis of speech and articulatory analysis of tongue movements. A detailed assessment is a prerequisite for the correct diagnosis and the selection of the most appropriate therapy procedures.
I speak fluent English and conversational Czech. However, I can help you or your child learn any speech sound of any language, as long as we can communicate in either English or Czech.

				<h2>ULTRASOUND TONGUE IMAGING</h2>
				<p>Ultrasound tongue imaging makes it possible to observe own tongue movements during speech.  Seeing your tongue makes it easier to understand the necessary tongue shape, position, or movements, and easier to control the tongue when articulating new speech sounds. The method has been proven to significantly shorten the duration of speech therapy. It can be used as a stand-alone method or as an addition to traditional speech therapy you already follow somewhere else.
Ultrasound is completely safe and uninvasive and is suitable for adults and children from about 5 years of age. More info in section Service.
